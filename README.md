# Precision Platformer

This project is a precision platformer game built in C++ using the Raylib library.

**Key Features:**

* **Experimental Shader:** Utilizes the alpha values of PNG textures to define layer depth, creating dynamic 3D lighting in a 2D game.
* **Custom Collision Detection:** Prevents fast-moving objects from passing through objects.
* **State Machine-Driven Player Movement:** The player's behavior is controlled by a state machine, allowing for fluid transitions between multiple actions.
* **Momentum-Based Gameplay:** The core mechanic revolves around accumulating horizontal velocity and strategically converting it to vertical momentum and vice versa.

**Technologies:**

* C++: The primary programming language used to develop the game logic and interact with Raylib.
* Raylib: A lightweight 2D and 3D game development library that provides a comprehensive set of tools for creating games.
